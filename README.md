I have added a login file in the project.
In login form file firstly you will see the page having background image welcome message and one button like login here, 
after clicking login here button you will see login form. 
In login form there is option to enter username and password and login botton,
i have also added a small monkey emogi to show and hide the password, 
if a new user want to login then they can sign in 
after clicking on sign in you will see sign up form having username password and conform password, here if you entered different password it will show the message like passwod doesn't match.
i created i user insted of giving name in file having username: Gayatri and password: Tayade
if these matches then and then only you can sees next page.
in sign up form here i have also added those monkey sign for password security
